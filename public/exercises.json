Stiff-legged deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight.

The feet are just outside the shoulders and grip placement is just inside of the legs. Many non-competitive lifters find this position to be more spine friendly and strong than either of the other traditional stances. This variation of the deadlift has all the same benefits as the others, and is capable of building serious full-body and posterior chain strength.",
